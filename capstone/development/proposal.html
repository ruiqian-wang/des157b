    <h3>Topic and Target Audience</h3>
    <p>
        My capstone project explores the concept of a <strong>Learning Map 2030</strong>, which is an interactive web design that visualizes how education may evolve over the next decade. It targets <strong>learners, educators, and career switchers</strong> who are trying to envision and plan their lifelong learning journey. As we move toward an era of AI tutors, microlearning credentials, and immersive educational environments, this project aims to help users anticipate change, reflect on their personal goals, and chart actionable learning paths across diverse futures.

    <h3>Theoretical Lenses</h3>
    <p>
        The project draws from the lenses of <strong>Speculative Design</strong>, <strong>Data Visualization</strong>, and <strong>Utopian/Dystopian Narratives</strong>. It challenges current mental models about where and how learning happens—beyond schools and degrees—by mapping modes like peer learning, gamified training, and AI‑driven mentorship.

    <h3>Imagined Features</h3>
    <p>
        I imagine features like a <strong>scrollable timeline</strong> from 2022–2030 and data-driven visual layers showing projected trends and technologies. These tools will allow users to explore both optimistic and cautionary scenarios in education's evolution.

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        Some areas I'm still exploring include how to source relevant data for visualization, and how to create an interface that works across learning backgrounds. The project may also need to address issues of accessibility and the personalization paradox.
